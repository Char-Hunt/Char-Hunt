### Hi there 👋 bonjour | こんにちは | ሰላም | नमस्कार | kamusta na | Mālō | Hallo | مرحبا | ஹலோ | Hola
My name is Char! I analyze and manage organizational systems and work to maintain core security principles including confidentiality, integrity and ethics.  My IT infrastructure analysis, Technical Writing/Editing, ITSM background and understanding of core business architecture gives a strong base to troubleshoot and provide solutions in networked environments. During my career I have worked in high-demand reactive, rapid response positions providing 24x7 support of incident management; and project/operations roles; deploying new applications and supporting technologies.

I excel at finding solutions for complex problems, delivering customer care excellence, and facilitating efficiencies, accountability, and results. I have diverse experience in information security, network access privileges, data integrity and governance, incident management, compliance management, financial systems administration and accounting applications analysis, and also business requirements. I am a naturally inquisitive learner and collaborative IT ally, with a passion for strategic problem solving and creatively aligning compliance programs with business objectives. I value exchanging insights, trends, and resources relevant to navigating change, on our own terms.
