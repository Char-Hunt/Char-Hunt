### Hi there 👋 bonjour | こんにちは | ሰላም | नमस्कार | kamusta na | Mālō | Hallo | مرحبا | ஹலோ | Hola
My name is Char! I analyze and manage organizational systems and work to maintain core security principles including confidentiality, integrity and ethics.  My IT infrastructure analysis and ITSM background, and understanding of core business architecture gives a strong base to troubleshoot, and provide solutions in networked environments. During my career I have worked in high-demand reactive, rapid response positions providing 24x7 support; and project/operations roles; deploying new applications and technologies.

I excel at finding solutions for complex problems, delivering customer care excellence, and facilitating efficiencies, accountability, and results. I have diverse experience in information security, network access privileges, IAM, data integrity and governance, incident management, compliance management, financial systems administration and accounting applications analysis, and business requirements. I am a naturally inquisitive learner and collaborative IT ally, with a passion for strategic problem solving and creatively aligning compliance programs with business goals and objectives. I value exchanging insights, trends, and resources relevant to navigating change, on our own terms.
